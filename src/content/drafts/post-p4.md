intro: "For Christmas when I was 8, my parents bought me my first editing software - Hollywood Studios. Life back then was simple. You go to store, you buy software on a CD, and then for the rest of your life as long as you have that CD you can edit videos with all the glam 2000's editing. Jump forward to today where my options are getting cucked by adobe, or pay $400 for access to the most basic level of editing tools. I recently suffered from trying out PC Mag reccomended Power Director 365 which was so insufferably terrible to use. My hunt for editing software so I can make money off of freelancing without feeling like I'm paying for the privege to work has been tiring."

So I've decided to give a new constentant a try - Enter Kdenlive. For this review I'm going to be working on a top to bottom video project for a client. This is one video in a series of video I make for them so I'm already familiar with the workload. I'm going to be comparing making the first one in the series to this one made on kden. How were the hours? Did I get the same effects, etc. For confidentiality reasons/not wanting to dox myself any images I show will be for a fake projects cause I don't want to get in trouble for sharing shit I shouldn't. So enjoy uma-fan-forever-v1.0finale.mp4

## What drew me in?
- absolutely free, no subscription, no "pro mode" no one time fee. Just free and open source good shit 
- came with a library of third party vectors and effects that are also free to use 
- UGC store for creators to share with each other. we love creative collaboration 
- doesn't require all clips to be encoded the same - finally I can use one person's iphone footage in the same video as someone's android footage
- They have a vectorscope and I love little charts that help me see if my edits are balanced or not 
- Auto subtitles software built in - I could never go back to hand writing them
- Auto back up because adhd is a disease

I hope these things prove useful. I'm going to compare my most current video editing suite Capcut to the other and see what I like. 

## What am I taking note on

1. How easy is it to use?
2. How precise am I able to be?
3. Are the high level effects worth it on shitty footage?
4. How much variety do I have in the library of provided effects?
5. Are there any secret "traps" to pay more?

 and finally .... would I recomend
