            Oh tsunderes - gotta love em. gotta pretend to hate them so they
            dont get overwhelmed by your love. gotta display love in a
            non-threatening way and accept all their attacks as grattitude for
            that love. Are they okay?
        </p>
        <p>
            Notably Narita Taishin is not. BBG needs robatussin and to give her
            inner child a hug. I love when it is revealed that she understands
            her biggest hater is herself - not anyone else. While her
            self-loathing isn't admirable, her determination and fortitude are.
            I can't wait to make that bitch win a tripple crown, YOUR TIME IS
            coming Taishin just wait.
        </p>
        <p>
            question - is it offensive to call her "shortie" as a form of
            endearment?
