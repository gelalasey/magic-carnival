intro: "Imagine me - it's 2016 and I'm sitting at a tea party in my cutest Innocent World coord (back when I had EGL money). My friend at the table pulls out her phone to quick do her gatcha game dailies at the reset time. I peek over to see an adorable sparkly pink app with 9 anime girls wearing the most adorable stage costumes I've ever seen. '3, 2, 1, LIVE!' blasts out of the tiny iphone speakers before a mario kart esque tune begins to play. She looks up from her screen to see me gawking and asked me the question that would change my entire life. 'Have you ever heard of Love Live?' "

---

From that point on my entire life changed. I have a playlist that is currently 51 hours long dedicated to the kawaii and happy music genre of idols. I cosplayed, covered, bought merch and basically sold my soul to any anime or group that had just the right color pallet and amount of glitter. I cannot begin to describe how much of my life changed the moment I was introduced to the genre of idols. It's like something I had been looking for my whole life I didn't know existed. Dancers and singers with a huge emphasis on camp and aesthetic. Their upbeat messaging and hard work ethic would motivate me on my worst mental illness days. "Do it for her" collages would be on my phone to push me through those darker days. I don't meant to sound dramatic or sappy - I can't think of another media that really touched my soul and showed me something that resonated so deeply. 

Today I hope to give a good snapshot of my favorite points about muse (which I will no longer write stylistically because it's too much work.) I know they are old news but they will always hold a special place in my heart. Be sure to [let me know](https://users3.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&i=g36-39145-c7) if you were a muse fan and who your oshis are too!

# Oshi 

Ms. Kotori Minami, Legendary Maid Minalinsky herself. I have yet to find another idol that captures the wholesome sweetness and purity that Kotori does. She's peppy but not obnoxious. She's stylish but relatable. She's so stinking cute. No 'but' to that. She just really is so cute. She is the ultimate ideal of what I love about idols, and she's probably the reason white is one of my favorite oshi colors. In so many ways I do not relate to her - but she is moreso someone I wish I could be like. Kotori really takes the meaning of being an idol to the finish line.

# Bias Wrecker 

I have a huge soft spot for the second years. You know I love a prim and proper ice queen that gets easily overwhelmed by her chaotic friend's whacky adventure. Those types of characters are my bread and butter, my rice and soy sauce. Just what ever balance anime diet needs! She deserves an honorable mention and a solid bronze metal. I'm sure not getting first is going to mentally scar her as a burnt out gifted student but ...eh it builds character. If it helps - one of the best singing voices in muse.

*I will still be in shambles if anyone shows me this scene*

The real title of "bias wrecker" goes to her goofball partner in crime Honoka. Now Honoka is a bitch I can relate to. We both have adhd, we both love carbs, we both are really motivated yet equally whiny about putting in the work. I'm sure one of the reasons I grew to love this series was because I saw so much of myself in Honoka. She didn't have to be the most talent in school or have the best voice or anything. She just had a dream and wanted it. And as I re-examine what makes her so special almost 10 years from our first introduction, I am so grateful that she was the idol who brought me into this genre. If only I could have built a successful (key word successful) 9 person idol group in my japanese high school and went to perform countless stages together. I never met her success - but she always reminds me to dream big.

# Subunit 

You'd think with two of my bias's being in Printemps that would be the group for me right? *Incorrect* Yeah Sweet& Sweet Holiday was iconic... but Bibi...that's where the REAL songs were at. Cutie Panther and the subsequent masterpiece [Cutie Bodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wYC0fAVL0E&list=RD5wYC0fAVL0E&start_radio=1) was the type of mp3 fuel we neurodivergents need to THRIVE! Natsu, Owaranai de is so soft and comforting when I am alone. Fuyu ga Kureta Yokan is a song I will sing at the top of my lungs despite knowing less that 20% of the lyrics. Trouble Busters and it's insanity laden beat map on SIF drives me into a clinical level of mania. Psychic Fire? More like "God damn ascend me to another plane of existance". That's not even a successful play on words - but it doesn't need to be. It's just *good*. Why do you need me to accurately describe them. Just go listen to it for yourself. 


# Favorite Song

I watched this and immediately was transported to a simpler time. The shoddy 3D animation doesn't stop me from wanting to dance along. The colors, the choreography, the perfect slice of life splicing. Those curtains rise and I'm in my happy place. 

# Favorite Costumes

## anime 

Look at my fairy princess babies - just look at them. Middle school me is vommiting on the floor trying to self his soul to get her paws on this.  I know the flower crowns seem a bit dated - but the whole look is so beautiful. And it was thankfully also one of those costumes where the cosplay also looked great irl.

Oh little devil set - you may in fact be the cutest thing to exist. This was a cosplay I dreamed of but never had the confidence to wear. And now of course that my adult body is too large to wear the ready made costumes I'll have to wait until I get semi talented at sewing to ever get the chance to do so. This is how you mix idol sweetness with a sassy wink. In the context of them being actual children I find the bralette tops a little ... too much. But on an objective fashion lense thinking of costumes I like it's flawless. And it's the perfect coincidence that my favorite aqours set is the angel set... but more on that another time.
