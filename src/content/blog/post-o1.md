intro: "Love and Deepspace - the Otome set to take the market by storm. It was a game from infold - the company supposedly making games for women by women. And it had me deep in its clutches, especially when Sylus came around. But just like Nikki and other modern games, I find these games to lack a meaningful story and sense of completion that other media in the past has had. The interactivity was great, but even at my lonelinest moments it was hard to feel like I could connect with the players. Here's a walk down memory lane - it's hard to really give a complete story line but I will say I primarily played this game in 2024. So unless you've never played the game I shouldn't be spoiling too much."

In a future sci-fi world where black holes, alien zombies called "wanderers" and crystal cancer exist - you play as a young "hunter" whose job it is to protect the city from outside threats. Through your connections to various men you are able to uncover a mystery that connects your childhood heart condition, strange workplace anomalies, mysterious rumors of mermaids and the deep underground hidden in the city. Something in side you creates an unstable powerful force, and it not only attracts danger - but the hotties as well for some reason. 

# The Routes

This game doesnt force you to pick one guy and finish the route - how could you this game has no end haha. But it is nice to be able to date multiple men at the same time and not worry about any of them getting jealous. Very rarely did any of them even acknowledge one another. Almost all scenes were between you and your LI with a few background characters peppered in for fun. There was the main story line but also several light hearted or AU events and side stories. They ranged from wholesome to literally one step away from softcore (looking at you time of the month stories). So let's get into the **boys**

## Snoozefest Xavier

Try as I might I could not give this dude the light of day (pun intended). First of "sleepy" is not a personality trait, I've never understood that as an anime trope. Why they're so sleepy is much more interesting to me. He is so vanilla plane jane boring that it would almost be interesting to meet someone like that in real life. I don't even have conversations screen shots from him bc the texts would literally be like "Wow I saw a cloud today and it was pretty fluffy". His whole thing just seemed to be ...being hot. Which when you're a 2d man I'm sorry you'll have to do better. I *expect* you to be hot as the bare minimum. Give me more. 

I also dislike how in events they would try to give him a """dominant""" air. Really it was embarassing. I love a good dom energy daddy baddie but like...how am I supposed to fear this man. What's he going to do? Fall asleep on me? Talk about stars for 3 hours? There's nothing interesting about him and I could gone the entire story without him. And YES I did read his backstore in the myths section. Did it *slightly* provide more depth for this character, yes. But how come we didn't see any of that integrated into his actual character. Where was this responsibility avoiding slacker boy that could properly contrast MC's hardworking ethos? You can tell me it's a translation issue till the cows come home, translation doesn't solve boring honey. There's a reason his nickname in my phone was "white bread".

## Whiny Rafayel

As you can see I'm going in order or hate to love. And Raf is a significant jump up from Xavier. Despite me not being romantically interested in his character, I still *enjoyed* his character. When I go into an otome I don't expect to fall in love with each guy equally, that would mean they haven't created compelling characters. And Raf is a great example of how I can enjoy a character without them being my type. His [Pauly Shore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ArXSwALDU) vocal tone and aggressive helplessness is not what I'm into. But man was he fun to talk to.

## Daddy Zayne 

Please I can fix him. Or he can fix me? Or we can both do a joint therapy session followed by trip to the bakery. It doesn't matter - what's important is that we're all traumatized here and Zayne is going to make this a safe sensory space for all of us. God bless the man willing to basically be my physician, secretary, nutritionist, trainer, confidant, and virtual assitant. He's basically here for you to outsource your life to and still manages to make time for cuddling. When does he sleep? Unknown and frankly unimportant. Why waste time trapped in your unconscious having to confront the horrors you've witnessed in battle when you could be alphabetizing your pantry.

"I don't want to be incapable capable of doing anything again when I become a threat to her" - Zayne WU 1.3

The one aspect of his character I never bought was the attempt to make him feel dangerous. That's already covered by the man who literally holds weapons up to my head - and there's **two** of them that do that. What's the worst Doc McStuffins is going to do? Withhold my daily vitamin. Fat chance, he would break first. I get he's supposed to be daddy and tells me to go to bed - but like I'm honestly listening to his advice in the same way I listen to my alarm going off after the 4th snooze - yeah yeah I get it already **fine**. Not every man needs to be assigned an ABO role...although I'd put him squarely as a beta.

## Yandaddy Caleb 

Oh how you confuse me Caleb. First I find you hot, then I find out you're my psuedo brother, then I find out that some people think that makes you more attractive, and right when my spinning head is ready to vomit this man comes out in full military attire (+10 for style) and threatens me in an interrogation. Very rarely did I feel nothing during a Caleb scene. It either hit good like OG Kush or it just hit me in the nose. I'm giving him second over Zayne only because his voice was less annoying (Zayne's voice was one of the ones that really had me buying into the AI voice actor rumors). Caleb is more lively and dynamic. And he has also "been through some shit" although I never fully dove into his story as far as I had with Zayne. Also he's hotter... and I'm shallow when it comes to animated men.

## Grandaddy Sylus
You'll notice a pattern here soon enough - if he's dangerous, has white hair, heads some secret power organization, and treats me like property I am **committed**. And Sylus checks all those boxes. First chapter - he's pulling out guns on me, tying me up, setting henchmen on me. Second chapter he's dressing me up, taking me to expensive parties, still finding ways to threaten my life. This is the prime rib of otome content I live for.

I would commit so many crimes for this man. If we were second half and this was a classic otome I would full stop quit my job and join his side. I'd dismantle the united nations if this man asked me to. He's the perfect fantasy of dating and world building. Who doesn't want to be a classy undercover spy in a shady black market? I read every one of his stories top to bottom (eheh) getting lost in the fantasy of Onychinus. I loved the twins, I loved Mephisto, I loved his weapon's room. This is what made setting a story in a sci fi realm worth it to me. 

In terms of his personality he was such a delicious parfait layer of traits. He was dangerous yes, but he was also sweet and considerate. He was sassy but occassionally had darker pessimism hidden underneath. You really never knew what you were going to get with him. There's a reason I see him labled as a switch so often in fics - he's interesting and diverse. And that is why I call him the grand-daddy ... i mean he is old man energy but also because he is **supreme**

# Why I Quit

So ultimately why then - if there are so many kings in this otome castle - did I quit? Well two main reasons: money and attention. In terms of the money I am happy to support a game. I'm pretty squarely a seal when it comes to gatcha games - if I like it I'll dedicate a frequent monthly purchase. But I'm also dirt poor and don't have much to spend on. I ultimately like to keep my budget between 10-30 a month depending on the game and events. But I get *so* burnt out with gatcha. I think the longest I've ever lasted was 2 years when I used to play LLSIF and that's because I had a social group to talk about the game with. Call me old fashioned - but why can't I just pay for a game one time and call it a day? You can only create so much teasing soft core material that I have to grind endless button pushing in order to unlock. And ultimately that's what lead to reason number 2. 

I don't think gatcha models are sustainable or successful. They may "work" in the sense that customers are paying for them, but it fatigues people. Eventually it won't be worth even investing in good story and models because in order for gatcha to work people have to be constantly enthralled with novelty and high energy. And even that wears people down. And I'm sure I'm not the only one out there who picks up an otome gatcha, plays it religiously for a few months, and then abandons it. Game companies are going to pour in less and less resources knowing that a long term investment isn't worth the returns. And shitty companies like infold with their [horrid anti-consumer practices](https://otome.com/2025/08/20/love-and-deepspace-false-advertisement/) will be paving the way, mark my words. I feel like infold at it's heart has a good vision - but greedy decisions made at whatever level keep people from being able to truly enjoy a well made story. 

Call me when someone's been able to take all the assets and turn this into a f2p game. Maybe then I'll give it another shot. But if a story never has an ending - I'm frankly to tired to try to keep up with it. 

Goddamn it maybe Xavier was right after all.
