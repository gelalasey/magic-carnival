        <h2>faq about my practice</h2>
        <mark>is this a closed practice?</mark>
        <p>
            I primarily practice Staroverstvo paganism and slavic native faith
            and both are open to all those who have open hearts and minds! While
            Slavic Native Faith is geared towards those who have slavic
            heritage, it's not something you have to be born into. I encourage
            if you are slavic to look up practices specific to your region (mine is mostly based out of the Slovenian Dolenska region). And
            if you're new to Slavic culture - Dobrodošli!
        </p>
        <mark>What region are you from?</mark>
        <p>I am south Slavic with some western and celtic influences.</p>
        <mark>were you raised in the practice?</mark>
        <p>
            Yes and No. I was raised Catholic but came to understand a lot of
            how our family practiced was rooted in slavic pagan traditions. The
            south slavs were conquered by Christians very early on and hid a lot
            of their practice through a method called <a
                href="https://slife.org/slavic-paganism/">"double faith"</a
            >. As I do more research I'm understanding more of what my family
            has practiced is tied to this culture.
        </p>
        <mark>Why am I finding so many ... Natzi references?</mark>
        <p>
            While many neo natzi groups have tried to <a

            >
                co-opt slavic iconography</a
            > or traditions in order to spread their hatred and racism, the core
            movement itself esposes inclusivity and diversity. However it is very
            important to vet sources, communities, and retailers in this world to
            avoid associating with the wrong crowd. Learn more about <a

        <mark>So cool you use swasticas?</mark>
        <p>
            uh no. ᵕ̈ while I understand some people wanting to " reclaim" the
            symbol - I do not. There's plenty of other spritual symbols that
            have a lot of meaning and historical value that
            <b>dont</b> make me or others feel threatened. I understand the intent
            - but there's still too much modern use of this symbol to justify reclaiming
            it. In all aspects of my practice - safety first.

        <h3>a bit of advice</h3>
        <p>
            The slavic pagan tradition was primarily passed down through oral
            tradition. Most written accounts were done by Christian who often
            mistook or exaggerated the practices they wrote about with the
            intent of dissuading paganism and pagan practices. Try to make sure
            you're seeing information from multiple credible sources.
