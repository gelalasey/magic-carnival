intro: "Hey Gamers! This is my first time creating my own umpd strat guide - I hope at this point I have a bit of knowledge about what I‚Äôm talking about üòÖ My goal is to create one buffed af Maruzensky for the Cancer Cup coming up on global. I honestly watched so many different youtube videos getting other people‚Äôs inputs that I didn‚Äôt write down all my sources. Next time I‚Äôll try to be more diligent about credit. Anyway here‚Äôs my plan for total victory!"

*updated 10/19/25 to reflect results*

Before we get into this too far - I did want to say that I ended up placing first in B group with this build. In the end I will probably NEVER do ggparents or gparents again unless I'm trying to make a longer term team build or something. it was just tooooo much work and burned me out when i actually needed to grind for the final Maru. 

# Quick Facts

- Cancer Cup is a tokyo track 1600m mile race with sunny weather, counter clockwise direction and firm turf. 
- I plan to run Maru as a front runner since she‚Äôs my strongest mile runner and then use one of the more successful parents as  back up. I may or may not include a debuffer later on. Otherwise I‚Äôll just use the other parent. 
- My goal stat minimums are 10 speed, 6 stamina, 8 power, 3 guts and 6 wisdom. I‚Äôm putting more into wisdom since maru has so many good natural mile skills.

After getting inspired by [UmaPokke‚Äôs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82KW2lni390&t=222s) video on how ‚Äúwhite farming‚Äù works - I‚Äôve decided to create my build backwards. I will start thinking about what white sparks I want and use those to build my pool of skills I want. These will serve as my great grandparents and reduce my need for more specialized cards later in the run. As you can see I‚Äôm aiming to create 5 total great grandparents - Oguri, El, Maru, Sakura and Suzu. The Maru repeats a lot just because she helps boost the compatibility. I‚Äôve already created my great granparents  and here‚Äôs where I landed with them. 

- **Oguri Cap** -  Corner acc., Takurazaka, Yasuda, Corner adept, Focus
- **Sakura Bakushin O** - Sprinters stakes, Corner adept, focus
- **Silent Suzuka** - URA 2, focus , green
- **El Condor Pasa** - Left handed, Corner Acceleration, URA Finale 1
- **Maruzensky** -URA Finale, Derby 1

## Grandparents

Next will be my grandparents - I‚Äôll be focusing on maintain the current white sparks obtained and attempt to at least keep if not raise their star level. Now I will also be focusing on including a useful blue skill. 

- **Grass Wonder (Oguri)** - Power 2 star, Corner Acc., Corner Adept, Ground Work (Using my SSR Oguri support)
- **Grass Wonder (Maru)** - Stam 2 star, Corner Acc. Corner Adept, Groundwork
- **Taiki Shuttle** - Power or Speed 2 Star, Sprinters stakes, Front Runner, Mile Corner
- **Mihono Bourbon** - URA 2, Focus, Suzuka‚Äôs Green, Front Corner

## Parents 
![](/blog/game/g6-3.png)

Once I‚Äôve got my grandparents set it‚Äôs time to start grinding the triangle over and over again until I get my perfect parents. At this point I‚Äôll be trying to maintain as many of my white sparks as I can with only a few skills being **completely** necessary for the build. I‚Äôll also be finalizing my blue and pink skills

### Mihono Bourbon

**Blue and Pink:** Stamina Spark, Front Runner Spark

**Must have sparks:**  URA 2,  Suzuka‚Äôs Green,  Takurazaka or Yasuda Race,
**Bonus sparks:** Focus, Corner Acc., Corner Adept, Groundwork

### Taiki Shuttle

**Blue and Pink:** Speed/Power Spark, Mile Spark

**Must have sparks**: Sprinters stakes, Takurazaka or Yasuda Race,
**Bonus sparks**: Corner Adept, Focus, Front Corners, Mile Corner, Corner Acc.

# Cards

Once I have my parents set - then it‚Äôs time to really decide my final deck. I will be using 3 speed, 2 power and 1 wit ideally. I‚Äôll be picking my cards based on what sparks I‚Äôm missing or want to increase my chances on. 

## Speed

- SSR Kitasan Black: Corner adept/Professor of Curvature, Focus
- SSR: Suzuka: Left hand, Focus, Front Corners

## Power

- SSR Oguri Cap: Corner adept/Professor of Curvature, Corner Acc., groundwork, homestretch haste
- SR Daitaku Helios: Mile Corners

### Wit

- SSR Fine Motion: Straight Acc, Corner Adept


**Other Cards that I may include simply because they are reliable/relevant to this training include:**

- SSR Nishino Flower: Her events give lots of good bonuses and she‚Äôs pretty decent speed card
- SSR Goldship: If I end up getting two power cards I may use her stamina card because there are some other useful skills in there like groundwork or uma stan
- SR Mihono Bourbon: Useful front runner skills and decent power card
- SR King Halo: Homestretch haste can be got through a random event, she‚Äôs also good specialty priority and speed gain.

# FINAL MARU

### Musts:

- Red Shift - Accel at final corner (get to highest level)
- Prof of Curvature

- homestretch haste

### Only if I‚Äôve got Extras:

- Groundwork
- Straight adept - vel at straight
- green skills
