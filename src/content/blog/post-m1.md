  <p style="width:175px;" >this is literally what i look like with he/him pronouns in my bio. Hayate is a perfect example of how gender is whatever the fuck you want it to be. He does <a href="https://youtu.be/q-rW8c2qhwI?t=41">identify as a boy</a> and i love his confidence in expressing himself. he's been in rindo for a long while with other groups and from what i see he seems really professional and hardworking.</p></div>

# favorite MV

"すとーきんぐ♡LOVE" (Stalking Love) is a perfect combination of how they keep the cute factor up with a bit of edge. I love how hard the refrain goes, i love the weird combination of men in crop tops whacking who also are shooting guns, I love them kidnapping and doing knock off saw with themselves. honestly i can understand this not being for everyone - but those who like this **love this**

I didn't want to give it to stalking love again bc that song goes so hard....while this song is a bit newer I really enjoy it. It's got my hallmarks for a fav song - fast speed, included wota guide, head banging guitar...not sure if it will stand the test of time but i'm allowing it to claim the top spot for today.

## winner

it's a hard world, you can't escape it. don't hold it in, just say it! be selfish!

I fell in love beat and melody first. the lyrics came later. it's so fun and playful.
