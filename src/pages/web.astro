            i hadn't heard much about the new web movement until one day i got
            on the right side of youtube and watched a <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yko-LMBrRQw&t=11s"
                >LuvstarKei IRL</a
            > video. I remember building cool pages like this before - my Tumblr
            account, my sister's Tumblr account...another Tumblr account. Point being
            I learned how to change the background image and felt like a bonafied
            hacker.

            this inspired me to get back to the thing i love most - building my
            own little world. Sometimes my little neurodivergent brain was happy
            arranging my mom's nail polishes and imagining the social dynamics
            between the short pinks and taller reds. i've completely lost track
            of what the purpose of this paragraph was.

                no content guidelines, no text limit, and no format restrictions
            </li>
            <li>
                <mark>skill building</mark> - i'm putting css and html on my resume

            </li>
            <li>
                <mark>nostalgia</mark> - so many of the resouces out there pay homage
                to old web, it's hilarious watching young zoomers posting "rawrxd"
                blinkies in their profiles

            So i can't teach you how to code...or build a website. But i can
            teach you how i learned to do it.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <mark>explore the sites</mark>: check out my <a

                > to other pages and see what they've created. get inspired and know

            </li>
            <li>
                <mark>get a template</mark>: the scary open notepad was very
                intimidating at first, but editing a template was the training
                wheels i needed to learn my divs from my ps
            </li>
            <li>
                <mark>eat sleep and breathe tutorials</mark> i still find myself
                googling "how to make image centered", if you have seen it online
                it can be done. learn the terminology you need and eventually you
                will figure it out. it's like a puzzle
